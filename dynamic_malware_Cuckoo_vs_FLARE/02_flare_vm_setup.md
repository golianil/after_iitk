# FLARE VM (Mandiant) — Detailed Setup Guide for Malware Analysis Workstation — 2025

FLARE VM is a curated Windows toolkit for reverse-engineering and malware analysis maintained by Mandiant. It uses Chocolatey and Boxstarter to automate installation of many analysis tools.

> **Important**: FLARE VM is a Windows-based analyst workstation, not an automated sandbox. Use it for interactive reversing, debugging, and manual dynamic analysis. citeturn0search2

## Recommended host/guest & licensing
- **Guest OS**: Windows 10 (21H2 or later) or **Windows 11** (recommended for latest driver support). Many community notes in 2024–2025 suggest Windows 10/11 are supported; check FLARE-VM GitHub for up-to-date compatibility. citeturn0search17turn0search2  
- **Hypervisor**: VMware Workstation / ESXi, VirtualBox, or Hyper-V (VMware often preferred for analyst workflows).  
- **RAM**: 8–16 GB for the VM (16+ recommended if you run multiple tools).  
- **Disk**: 80+ GB (tools + symbol stores + workspace).  
- **Licensing**: For Windows guests, use a valid license or evaluation ISO under Microsoft terms for lab use.

## High-level install steps
1. Create a fresh Windows VM (Windows 10/11) and update Windows fully (Windows Update). Enable snapshots. Configure host-only or NAT networking depending on whether you want Internet access. **Prefer isolated network** for malware analysis. citeturn0search17

2. Install prerequisites (PowerShell, .NET, Chocolatey)
- Open PowerShell as Administrator and install Chocolatey if not present:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force
[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072
iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
```

3. Run FLARE-VM installer (official GitHub)
- From an elevated PowerShell prompt run the FLARE-VM install script. Check the repository for the latest install command; a common pattern is:
```powershell
# Example (verify URL on FLARE-VM repo first)
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force
iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mandiant/flare-vm/master/install.ps1'))
```
- The installer uses Chocolatey + Boxstarter packages to install dozens of tools; this process may take 1–3 hours depending on network and system speed. citeturn0search2turn0search16

4. Optional: run FLARE-VM package group installs or customize packages as needed. See the GitHub repo for package lists and optional add-ons.

## Tools installed (examples)
FLARE VM installs a large collection of tools; common ones include:
- IDA Free/Pro (if licensed), Ghidra, x64dbg, WinDbg, Process Explorer, Process Monitor (Procmon), PEStudio, CFF Explorer, GDB, Radare2, YARA, bulk_extractor, Volatility/Volatility3, Wireshark, Python, Binwalk, and many more. The exact list is on the FLARE-VM GitHub. citeturn0search2

## Post-install configuration & best practices
- **Snapshot the VM** after a clean install + after FLARE-VM toolset is installed (clean state).  
- Configure shared clipboard/drag-drop carefully — disable in malware analysis VMs to avoid host contamination.  
- Optionally maintain a second FLARE VM image used only for live debugging (separate from analysis guest that runs malware).  
- Keep a fresh copy of symbol servers and set up WinDbg symbol path for better debugging.  
- For memory forensics, install and configure volatility/volatility3 and ensure Python environments are properly set.

## Updating FLARE VM
- FLARE VM packages are maintained via Chocolatey/Boxstarter. To update, fetch the latest package definitions from the GitHub repo and re-run the installer or specific package installers. Check issues/milestones on the repo for 2025 activity and known issues. citeturn0search4turn0search10
