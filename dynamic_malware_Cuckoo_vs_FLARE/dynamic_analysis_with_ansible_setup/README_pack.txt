Malware Analysis Automation Pack (Cuckoo provisioning + FLARE VM helpers)

Included:
- Vagrantfile (cuckoo host base VM)
- ansible/playbook-cuckoo.yml (Ansible playbook to install Cuckoo & base deps on Ubuntu 22.04)
- FLARE VM installer PowerShell script (FLARE_VM_custom_install.ps1) for Windows 10/11 guest
- A short PPTX summary (4 slides): malware_analysis_summary.pptx

Usage:
1) Ensure you have Vagrant and VirtualBox installed on your host machine.
2) Clone or place this directory on your host.
3) To create the Cuckoo host VM:
   - vagrant up
   - The /vagrant/ansible directory is synced; run from host or inside the VM:
     ansible-playbook -i 'default,' -c local /vagrant/ansible/playbook-cuckoo.yml
   - Review and edit config files in ~/cuckoo/.cuckoo (or /home/cuckoo/.cuckoo)
4) Prepare guest images (Windows evaluation ISOs require proper licensing) and set up Cuckoo agent in guests.
5) For FLARE VM, run FLARE_VM_custom_install.ps1 in an elevated PowerShell session inside the Windows VM (after enabling snapshots).
6) Always isolate networks, snapshot before running samples, and follow the checklist from the main pack.

Security & Ethics:
- Only analyze malware in isolated lab environments with explicit authorization.
- Do not expose C2 or malware to public Internet.
