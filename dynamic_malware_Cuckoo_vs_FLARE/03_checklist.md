# Quick Checklist & Safety Tips (Cuckoo + FLARE VM)

- Isolate networks (host-only or air-gapped).  
- Take fresh snapshots: host before install, guest clean snapshot, post-setup snapshot.  
- Use separate physical machine or isolated host for dangerous samples.  
- Keep copies of Cuckoo and FLARE-VM docs/bookmarks for updates.  
- Use hashed storage (SHA256) naming for samples, and keep an analysis log.  
- When in doubt, analyze offline (no network) until you are ready to allow controlled egress through proxy.
