# 4. Language curricula (detailed)

## Python — security-focused (what to learn & projects)
**Why:** scripting, automation, PoC, tooling, parsing, integration with tools and APIs.
**Duration target:** 4–8 weeks intensive, ongoing practice.

### Core topics & modules
- Language fundamentals: functions, OOP, modules, packaging, venv.
- Networking: `socket`, `asyncio`, `requests`, `http.server`, `urllib`, `scapy` (packets & crafting).
- Binary / bytes handling: `struct`, `binascii`, `io`, encoding/decoding, bytes ↔ strings, handling CRLF in EML parsing.
- Subprocess & OS interaction: `subprocess`, `os`, `shutil`, `tempfile`.
- File formats & parsing: `email` (EML), `mailbox`, `pefile` (PE parsing), `pyelftools` (ELF), `pdfminer` (PDF parsing).
- Automation/APIs: `paramiko` (SSH), `requests`, REST API patterns, `python-dotenv` for config.
- Security libs: `pwntools` (exploit dev), `capstone` python bindings, `pycryptodome` (crypto primitives), `frida` (dynamic instrumentation), `yara-python` (rule matching).
- Testing & CI: `pytest`, `tox`, basic unit tests for tools.

### Practical projects (Python)
1. **EML parser → feature extractor**: extract headers, SPF/DKIM fields, URLs, attachments metadata, produce numeric features (for ML or scoring). (Directly fixes the bug you saw earlier.)
2. **Small Post‑exploitation tool**: a script to enumerate system info and exfiltrate to a C2 (lab only).
3. **Network scanner & vuln scanner**: use `scapy` and `requests` to discover ports and fingerprint services.
4. **YARA-based attachment scanner**: use `yara-python` to scan a directory of attachments and output CSV/JSON.

### How to practice (steps)
- Week 1: Write scripts that parse EML and extract headers, decode bytes to string robustly.
- Week 2: Use `pefile` to enumerate imports/sections; produce CSV row for each PE.
- Week 3: Build a CLI tool with `argparse` and unit tests for parsing functionality.
- Week 4: Integrate feature extraction + small ML model (sklearn) to classify simple benign/malicious labels (toy dataset).

---

## C / C++ — security-focused (what to learn & projects)
**Why:** Most memory corruption vulnerabilities originate here; exploit primitives require C understanding.
**Duration target:** 6–12 weeks (ongoing with projects).

### Core topics & concepts
- Build system basics: `gcc`, `clang`, `make`, `cmake`.
- Memory model: stack vs heap, static/global, pointers, pointer arithmetic.
- Buffer overflows: stack buffer overflow, stack frame layout, return addresses, canaries.
- Heap internals: glibc malloc, fastbins, tcache, chunk metadata.
- UB, format strings, integer overflows, use-after-free, double free.
- Modern mitigations: ASLR, NX/DEP, stack canaries, RELRO, PIE, control flow guards.
- C++ specifics: vtables, RTTI, virtual functions, object layout, memory management pitfalls.
- Secure coding patterns: bounds checking, safe APIs, sanitizer use (ASan, UBSan).

### Practical projects
1. **Vulnerable C program**: write intentionally vulnerable apps (stack overflow, format string, heap UAF) and exploit them locally.
2. **ROP chain building**: generate ROP gadgets, bypass NX, create shellcode payloads.
3. **Exploit dev writeup**: document the exploit and mitigation checks.
4. **Fuzzing**: write simple fuzz harness for a parser using AFL or libFuzzer.

### How to practice (steps)
- Week 1–2: Build small C programs, compile with/without mitigations, inspect assembly with `objdump`/`gdb`.
- Week 3–4: Implement stack overflow PoC, then compile with canaries/PIE, adapt exploit.
- Week 5–8: Tackle heap exploitation labs (pwnable challenges) and fuzz a target parser.

---

## JavaScript (security-focused)
**Why:** Web application attacks, XSS, modern frontend logic, NodeJS attack surface.
**Duration target:** 3–6 weeks to usable level for pentesting web apps.

### Core topics
- DOM, event model, same-origin policy, CORS basics.
- XSS types: reflected, stored, DOM-based; CSP (Content Security Policy) bypasses.
- Modern frameworks (React/Angular/Vue) client-side pitfalls (unsafe `innerHTML`, unsanitized templates).
- Node.js: server-side JS, asynchronous model, common misconfigurations, prototype pollution.
- Web security testing: Burp Suite extensions in JS, writing small JS-based scanners or payload generators.

### Practical projects
1. **XSS lab**: create sample pages (vulnerable) and exploit various XSS types; craft payloads to exfiltrate cookies via `fetch`/`img` tags.
2. **NodeJS vuln demo**: set up small Express app with vulnerable `eval`/unsanitized deserialization, exploit and patch.
3. **Burp extension**: write a small extension that detects common header misconfigurations or insecure cookie flags.

---

# 5. Reverse Engineering & Assembly (practical path)
**Start:** x86_64 -> Windows userland -> ELF -> ARM.
- Tools: Ghidra (free), IDA (if available), Binary Ninja (if available), x64dbg, WinDbg, GDB, radare2.
- Learn to read: compile a C program with `-g` then step through with `gdb`; then strip and load in Ghidra to reconcile source↔binary.
- Practice: pwnable.kr, ROPemporium, HTB pwn boxes.
- Move to ARM when comfortable; Raspberry Pi images are great for cross-compilation and emulation with QEMU.

**Weekly progression (example)**
- Week 1: Compile simple C with debug symbols, use GDB to step through and view assembly.
- Week 2: Strip symbols, use Ghidra to analyze, map functions, recover strings.
- Week 3–4: Solve 2 pwnable challenges (basic), write exploit with pwntools.
- Month 2–3: Do heap challenges, learn use-after-free and tcache exploitation.

---

# 6. Cloud & Containers (practical path)
**Why:** modern attacks often target identity & misconfigurations in cloud.
**What to learn:** IAM (AWS IAM), role chaining, S3 misconfig, EC2 metadata service (IMDSv1/v2), Lambda privilege escalation, Kubernetes RBAC & secrets, container escapes.
**Practice setup:** use a low-cost AWS account (or LocalStack) and deliberately misconfigure resources. Build a small k8s cluster with minikube or k3s and simulate pod misconfigs.
**Projects:** S3 data exfil via public buckets, IAM role abuse demo, Kubernetes privilege escalation and sensitive secret access demo (lab only).

---

# 7. Machine Learning (applied & optional)
**Why optional:** not mandatory for red-team but valuable for malware triage and automation.
**Minimum:** scikit-learn, feature engineering, basic pipeline (pandas, sklearn), model eval metrics, simple neural nets with PyTorch for advanced tasks.
**Project:** PE metadata + import table + section entropy classifier; unsupervised clustering (DBSCAN) for triage grouping.

---

# 8. Cryptography & Algorithms (practical focus)
**What to learn:** symmetric/asymmetric primitives, hashing, HMAC, TLS overview, common crypto mistakes. **Don't** deep-dive into pure math unless you want crypto specialist role.
**Project:** analyze JWT misconfigurations, craft an example of algorithm downgrade or verification mistakes, break weak custom crypto in a contrived lab (educational only).

---

# 9. Consulting & Professional Skills
- **Documentation:** concise executive summary, technical findings, remediation steps, PoC code in appendices, severity & risk ranking, timeline, indicators.
- **Business skills:** proposal writing, client scoping, pricing models (fixed price vs per-day), NDAs, rules of engagement templates.
- **Practice:** volunteer to do a security review for a small org (with permission), produce a complete report and remediation plan.

---

# 10. Certifications (recommendations)
- Offensive: OSCP (Offensive Security) — hands-on. GPEN (GIAC) for complementary recognition.
- Defensive: GCIH, GCFA — if pivoting to DFIR/SOC side. Microsoft/Azure certs for cloud credibility.
- Consulting: CISSP for enterprise advisory credibility (optional; managerial).

## Weeks 11–13: Cloud basics + projects
- AWS: IAM misconfig exercises, S3, EC2 metadata demo.
- Kubernetes: minikube misconfig and RBAC demo.
- Finalize 3 polished writeups and prepare portfolio.

---

# 12. Project templates & deliverables (what to produce for portfolio)
- **Pentest report template**: Executive summary, scope, finding list, PoC steps, remediation, appendix (logs, screenshots, commands). (Use plain language + technical appendix.)
- **Writeups**: 3–6 detailed GitHub repos (redacted PoCs), one page executive summary for each.
- **Detection pack**: Splunk or Elastic queries + playbook for SOC.

---

# 13. Continuous learning & community
- Join HTB Slack, local BSides, infosec meetups. Participate in CTFs (CTFtime).
- Blog monthly about a lab or a tool; small talks at local meetups build consultant trust.

---

# 14. Risk, legal & ethics notes
- Always practice on systems you own or have explicit permission for. Unauthorized testing is illegal.
- When writing PoC code, keep it safe and avoid publishing live exploit code that can be abused without context and mitigations.

---

## Appendix — Quick cheat sheets
(1) **Typical exploit dev workflow**: source.c → compile → strip → run under debugger → examine binary (Ghidra) → find vuln → craft input → test locally → write exploit (pwntools) → test with mitigations off/on → document.
(2) **Pentest engagement flow**: Recon → Scanning → Exploitation → Post‑exploitation → Coverage mapping (MITRE ATT&CK) → Report → Remediation verification.
